"Why not announce thyself openly, and cast me off at once?"</p><p>"It may be," he replied, "because I will not encounter the dishonor that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman. It may be for other reasons. Enough, it is my purpose to live and die unknown. Let, therefore, thy husband be to the world as one already dead, and of whom no tidings shall ever come. Recognize me not, by word, by sign, by look! Breathe not the secret, above all, to the man thou wottest of. Shouldst thou fail me in this, beware! His fame, his position, his life, will be in my hands. Beware!"</p><p>"I will keep thy secret, as I have his," said Hester.</p><p>"Swear it!" rejoined he.</p></div> </div>
